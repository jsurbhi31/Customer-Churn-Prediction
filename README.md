# Customer-Churn-Prediction
Customer Churn also known as Customer Attrition/Loss of Clients. This is a typical problem which is being faced by many industries.
Acquiring new customers can be several times more expensive than retaining existing ones.
Types of Churn:
1) Contractual (Example: Netflix, Telecom Industry)
2) Non Contractual (Example: Online Fashion Retailer)
3) Voluntary (Example: Payment failure)
4) Non Voluntary (Example: Credit card Expiration)

In this project, i tried to identify the patterns in the data that help in identifying the proportion of churners.
Dataset : Telecom Industry Dataset( taken from IBM sample datasets)
Detailed explanation is provided in the R code file.

Summary of findings:
1)Contract, Tenure Group, Paperless Billing, Monthly Charges are some important parameters in deciding the customer churn rate.
2)Customers with one or two year contract and with tenure group more than 12 months are more likely to churn.
3)Gender, Senior Citizen have no role with the churn rate.

Recommendations:
Predict the probablity of churn and use it to flag customers for email campaigns.
Conducting customer questionaire using key indicators could be helpful.
Tracking the lifetime value of customer acquisiont channel when chosing to spend time and money.
